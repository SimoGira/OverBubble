# OverBubble
An intersection Detection Application (Mac OSX version)


This is a project made in preparation for application test (phase 1) to the Apple Developer Academy!
If you look for learn OOP on [mooodle](https://moodle.developeracademy.unina.it), you'll find some videos, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=428&v=V7k5bFQbhG0) that explains the same project in Java. 
I thought that it would be more useful have a Swift version, so I re-implemented it in Swift as well.
