# OverBubble
An intersection Detection Application (Mac OSX version)


This is a project made in preparation for application test ([SECTION 2 - General Coding and Object Oriented Programming)] (https://moodle.developeracademy.unina.it/course/view.php?id=7#section-2) to the Apple Developer Academy[https://moodle.developeracademy.unina.it/]!

If you look for learn OOP on [moodle](https://moodle.developeracademy.unina.it), you'll find some videos, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=428&v=V7k5bFQbhG0) that explains how to do the same project in Java. 

I thought that it would be more useful have a Swift version of the code, so I re-implemented the project in Swift as well.
